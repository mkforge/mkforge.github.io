## What is MKForge?

MKForge helps you get better answers from AI coding assistants like ChatGPT and Claude. Instead of copying and pasting individual files, MKForge creates a smart summary of your entire project that helps AI tools understand your code better.

### How It Works

1. Run `mkforge` in your project directory
2. Share the generated summary with your AI assistant
3. Get more accurate, context-aware help with your code

### Example Use Cases

- Get help fixing bugs by letting AI see the whole context
- Ask for code improvements with full project understanding
- Get better explanations of how your code works together
- Request new features with full project context

## Quick Install

### macOS/Linux (Recommended)
```bash
brew tap mkforge/homebrew-mkforge
brew install mkforge
```

### Direct Download

We provide pre-built binaries for all major platforms:

#### Linux/macOS

```
